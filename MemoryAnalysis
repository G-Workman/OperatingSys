Volatile Memory
	Non-persistent
	Requires power to maintain the stored information 
	It retains its contents while powered on but when the power is interrupted, the stored data is immediately lost
		RAM
		Cache
Non-Volatile Memory
	Persistent
	Does not require a continuous power supply to retain the data stored in a computing device
		HDD
		USB
WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?
	Data that has not been stored on disk yet is present in memory
	Files that have been deleted or modified can be scraped from RAM and used as evidence or for timelining an attack
	Examples:
		Bash history is written to .bash_history once the terminal session is terminated, 
		however each command that has been ran during the current terminal session resides in RAM and can be viewed using the bash plugin
		If the ~/.bash_history has been deleted, using the same method as above we can still retrieve all commands executed
		Logs that have been deleted or modified can be read and scraped from memory using the mfind mcat & mls plugins
MEMORY ANALYSIS
	Analyzing a system’s RAM to determine information about running programs, the operating system, and the overall state of a computer

ORDER OF VOLATILITY - THE HALFLIFE OF DATA
CPU registers, cache
Routing table, ARP cache, process table, kernel stats, memory
Temporary file systems
Disk
Remote logging and monitoring data
Physical configuration, network topology
Archival media - backups

VOLATILITY
Memory Analysis framework
Volatility provides cross-platform solutions on Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux
Each operating system has its own memory acquisition tool called Persistent Memory (pmem)
	Linpmem
	Winpmem
	OSXpmem
	
UNDERSTAND PROFILES AND PROFILE SELECTION/CREATION
What is a profile?
	A Profile provides Volatility with a memory layout based on the kernel of the machine upon which it’s created. 
	This ensures Volatility is able to parse the memory image appropriately and return expected data when given a command
	Volatility hosts a profile repository with most known Windows builds; however, their Linux profile selection is lacking
		Cloning the repository to a local machine is possible for offline analysis needs
	The best practice is to create your own profile for Linux machines

	-f 				.vmem filename
	--profile		specify profile you are loading
	--plugins		can be used to extract (imageinfo - for image to gain profile;
