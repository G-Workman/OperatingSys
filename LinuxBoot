POST - UEFI - GPT - GRUB.EFI - LINUX KERNEL - INIT - SYSTEMD (/lib/systemd/systemd) - Bring system desired login state

sudo dmidecode -t bios
    identifies BIOS
    
lsblk
    tells us what disks are in the system and where they are truly mounted
    
df -h
    tells us the size of the disk and where they are mounted
    
sudo parted -l
    shows information about the disk

sudo xxd -l 512 -g 1 /dev/vda                                      #or /dev/sda or /dev/hda
    shows the hex dump
    
eb 63 90
    'eb' = jump to 0x63
    
sudo dd if=/dev/vda of=MBRcopy bs=1 count=512                      #or /dev/sda or /dev/hda
    copies if to of byte by byte

The last 66 bytes represent partition and magic number is the last 2 bytes

BIOS
    First program to run on startup (flash or ROM)
        If stored in flash memeory -> becomes a target for BIOS Rootkits
    Performs POST (Power On Self Test)
    Performs system integrity checks
    Builds a device tree
    Reads and executes the first sector on the boot disk (MBR) to load bootloader to memory
MBR - Master Boot Record
    Located at the very beginning of the bootbable disk and contains the primary bootloader, partition table and MBR validity check
    Contains code for GRUB
    Could also contain LILO (Linux Loader)
    First 512 Bytes
    4 Primary Partitions w/ max of 2 TB each
    /dev/sda or vda or hda

GRUB - Grand Unified Bootloader
    cat /boot/grub/grub.cfg
    Dynamically configurable with the capability to make changes during boot
        Config file - /boot/grub/menu.lst
        Altering boot entries, selecting different kernels, and modifying the initial RAM disk (initrd)
    OS Selection screen where if no choice is made, default kernel specified in the grub config file
    GRUB passes text based kernel. If not recognized, the option will be passed to init
    Kernel options are sometimes configurable at the menu with the 'e' key
    
KERNEL
    Monolithic
    Uncompresses itself into RAM
    Establishes memory management, detects CPU type, and page tables
    Mounts the root '/' filesystem
    kernel is process 0 ([kthreadd] - PID 2)
    Supports modules
        sudo lsmod
            #list of modules and what uses them
    Executes /sbin/init or systemd daemon, the very first process started by the kernel with a process ID (PID) of 1
    ls -l /sbin/init
        determines which Init system you are using
            systemd has symbolic link
            systemV has no symbolic link
    ps -p 1
        gets short process listing of PID 1
INIT or SystemD
    
    Services and Process manager
    Parent of all Services
    Sys V uses Init, runlevels, and is serial 
        S - Start; K - Stop/kill
        Uses INITTAB as the configuration file
        name:Runlevel:Execution:Command
            Runlevels                                                                                       !!!SYSTEMD TARGETS!!!
